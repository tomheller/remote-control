# Remote Control Demo

![Codeship badge](https://codeship.com/projects/039a38c0-c83d-0133-7f5e-422803f7ed3f/status?branch=master)

Remote control a ThreeJS scene with your mobile phone.
This project intended for me to toy around with:
* SocketIO & Websockets
* Pairing with QR Codes
* Automated Deployment via Codeship
